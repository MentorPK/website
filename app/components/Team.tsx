            Hi, I'm Pawel Kowalski founder of "webpaw solutions". Currently a one man army at webpaw solution. 
            I started my developer journey during my first year of college on "FH Technikum Vienna" where i also graduated in 
            "Information and Communication Systems". After one year in college I had the opportunity to work at
            ecosio. This was my first IT job ever. In 2017 for the first 6 months I started as
            a website admin and switched after to the frontend department until 2022.
